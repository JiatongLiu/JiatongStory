  There was a boy named Kobe.  When he was a kid, he dreamed to become the best basketball player in the world. From that time, he practiced very hard and put all his time on basketball. Many years later, he lives his dream. He becomes one of the greatest basketball players in the world. He inspires a lot young people in the world.

Kobe made it to winning 5 Basketball Championships in his career. However, this did not come without some struggling times. Around 2013 Kobe missed the first 19 season games.
He did not give up though, and after a couple years he excelled in his final season in 2015-2016.  

Kobe then went to start again. He put on 100 hundred pounds of muscle and made a mask. He now went by the name Zion Williamson and tears up the NCAA nightly.

This type of thing is not fresh to Kobe, because everyone knows Kobe is actually Jordan. Since Jordan retired in 2001, Jordan put the "Kobe" mask on and used the name "Kobe" to continue his basketball career.
